## base-pet

Create one clean full-body reference sprite for Codex pet Rydia.

Pet identity: Cute chibi Rydia from Final Fantasy IV, based on the supplied woman reference. Emerald green long flowing hair, large blue eyes, red butterfly-like jeweled hair ornament on her left temple (viewer right), green gold-trimmed fantasy dress, green long gloves and green boots. Compact two-and-a-half-head-tall full-body proportions, sweet friendly expression. Simplify costume into tasteful closed bodice and short flared skirt for a cute mascot. Only Rydia, no dragon or other creature, no held props. Preserve ornament anatomical side across turns..
Style: Pet-safe sprite: compact full-body mascot, readable in a 192x208 cell, clear silhouette, simple face, stable palette/materials, and crisp edges for chroma-key extraction. Style `sticker`: Polished sticker mascot with bold clean shapes, crisp outline, flat colors, and minimal highlight detail. User style notes: Polished cute Japanese chibi character illustration, rounded silhouette, crisp colored outlines, soft cel shading, readable at desktop pet size; emerald jade palette, blue eyes, red accessory, warm gold trim..


Place a single centered pose on a perfectly flat pure magenta #FF00FF chroma-key background. Keep the full pet visible, compact, readable at 192x208, and easy to animate. Preserve approved reference identity cues. No scenery, text, borders, checkerboard transparency, shadows, glows, detached effects, or extra props. Keep #FF00FF and close colors out of the pet, props, highlights, and effects.



## failed

Create one horizontal animation strip for Codex pet `rydia`, state `failed`.

Use the attached canonical base for identity. Use the attached layout guide only for slot count, spacing, centering, and padding; do not draw the guide.

Output exactly 8 full-body frames in one left-to-right row on flat pure magenta #FF00FF. Treat the row as 8 invisible equal-width slots: one centered complete pose per slot, evenly spaced, with no overlap, clipping, empty slots, labels, or borders.

Identity: same pet in every frame: Cute chibi Rydia from Final Fantasy IV, based on the supplied woman reference. Emerald green long flowing hair, large blue eyes, red butterfly-like jeweled hair ornament on her left temple (viewer right), green gold-trimmed fantasy dress, green long gloves and green boots. Compact two-and-a-half-head-tall full-body proportions, sweet friendly expression. Simplify costume into tasteful closed bodice and short flared skirt for a cute mascot. Only Rydia, no dragon or other creature, no held props. Preserve ornament anatomical side across turns.. Preserve silhouette, face, proportions, markings, palette, material, style, and props.
Style: Pet-safe sprite: compact full-body mascot, readable in a 192x208 cell, clear silhouette, simple face, stable palette/materials, and crisp edges for chroma-key extraction. Style `sticker`: Polished sticker mascot with bold clean shapes, crisp outline, flat colors, and minimal highlight detail. User style notes: Polished cute Japanese chibi character illustration, rounded silhouette, crisp colored outlines, soft cel shading, readable at desktop pet size; emerald jade palette, blue eyes, red accessory, warm gold trim..
Animation continuity: keep apparent pet scale and baseline stable within the row unless the state itself intentionally changes vertical position, such as `jumping`. Move the pose within the slot instead of redrawing the pet larger or smaller frame to frame.

State action: Blocked/failed loop: slumped or deflated reaction with sad or closed eyes.

State requirements:
- Show failure through slumped pose, drooping ears/limbs, closed or sad eyes, and lower body position.
- Tears, small smoke puffs, or tiny stars are allowed only if attached to or overlapping the pet silhouette and kept inside the same frame slot.
- Do not draw red X marks, floating symbols, detached stars, separated smoke clouds, falling tear drops, dust, or other loose effects.

Clean extraction: crisp opaque edges, safe padding, no scenery, text, guide marks, checkerboard, shadows, glows, motion blur, speed lines, dust, detached effects, stray pixels, or chroma-key colors inside the pet.



## idle

Create one horizontal animation strip for Codex pet `rydia`, state `idle`.

Use the attached canonical base for identity. Use the attached layout guide only for slot count, spacing, centering, and padding; do not draw the guide.

Output exactly 6 full-body frames in one left-to-right row on flat pure magenta #FF00FF. Treat the row as 6 invisible equal-width slots: one centered complete pose per slot, evenly spaced, with no overlap, clipping, empty slots, labels, or borders.

Identity: same pet in every frame: Cute chibi Rydia from Final Fantasy IV, based on the supplied woman reference. Emerald green long flowing hair, large blue eyes, red butterfly-like jeweled hair ornament on her left temple (viewer right), green gold-trimmed fantasy dress, green long gloves and green boots. Compact two-and-a-half-head-tall full-body proportions, sweet friendly expression. Simplify costume into tasteful closed bodice and short flared skirt for a cute mascot. Only Rydia, no dragon or other creature, no held props. Preserve ornament anatomical side across turns.. Preserve silhouette, face, proportions, markings, palette, material, style, and props.
Style: Pet-safe sprite: compact full-body mascot, readable in a 192x208 cell, clear silhouette, simple face, stable palette/materials, and crisp edges for chroma-key extraction. Style `sticker`: Polished sticker mascot with bold clean shapes, crisp outline, flat colors, and minimal highlight detail. User style notes: Polished cute Japanese chibi character illustration, rounded silhouette, crisp colored outlines, soft cel shading, readable at desktop pet size; emerald jade palette, blue eyes, red accessory, warm gold trim..
Animation continuity: keep apparent pet scale and baseline stable within the row unless the state itself intentionally changes vertical position, such as `jumping`. Move the pose within the slot instead of redrawing the pet larger or smaller frame to frame.

State action: Calm low-distraction resting loop: subtle breathing, tiny blink, slight head/body bob, and only quiet persona-preserving motion.

State requirements:
- CRITICAL: idle is the low-distraction baseline state and the first frame is also used as the reduced-motion static pet.
- Use only subtle idle motion: gentle breathing, a tiny blink, a slight head or body bob, a very small material sway, or another quiet motion that fits the pet persona.
- Keep the pet essentially in the same pose, facing direction, silhouette, markings, palette, and prop state across all 6 frames.
- Idle variation must stay calm but still read as animation; do not repeat effectively identical copies across the loop.
- Do not show waving, walking, running, jumping, talking, working, reviewing, emotional reactions, large gestures, item interactions, or new props.
- Feet, base, body, or object anchor should remain planted or nearly planted.
- The first and last frames should be very close visually so the loop feels calm and does not pop.

Clean extraction: crisp opaque edges, safe padding, no scenery, text, guide marks, checkerboard, shadows, glows, motion blur, speed lines, dust, detached effects, stray pixels, or chroma-key colors inside the pet.



## jumping

Create one horizontal animation strip for Codex pet `rydia`, state `jumping`.

Use the attached canonical base for identity. Use the attached layout guide only for slot count, spacing, centering, and padding; do not draw the guide.

User style notes: Polished cute Japanese chibi character illustration, rounded silhouette, crisp colored outlines, soft cel shading, readable at desktop pet size; emerald jade palette, blue eyes, red accessory, warm gold trim..
Animation continuity: keep apparent pet scale and baseline stable within the row unless the state itself intentionally changes vertical position, such as `jumping`. Move the pose within the slot instead of redrawing the pet larger or smaller frame to frame.

State action: Hover jump loop: anticipation, lift, airborne peak, descent, and settle through body height.

State requirements:
- Show the jump through pose and vertical body position only: anticipation, lift, airborne peak, descent, settle.
- Do not draw ground shadows, contact shadows, drop shadows, oval shadows, landing marks, dust, smears, bounce pads, or motion marks under the pet.
- Keep the background outside the pet perfectly flat chroma key with no darker key-colored patches.

Clean extraction: crisp opaque edges, safe padding, no scenery, text, guide marks, checkerboard, shadows, glows, motion blur, speed lines, dust, detached effects, stray pixels, or chroma-key colors inside the pet.



## look-row-10

Create one horizontal look-direction strip for Codex pet `rydia`, atlas row 10.

Use the attached canonical base, completed standard contact sheet, layout guide, and approved four-cardinal strip for identity, scale, registration, spacing, direction semantics, and cross-row continuity. Read `qa/look-mechanics.md` and follow its pet-specific movement and eye/prop mechanics. The approved cardinal strip and completed coherent row 9 are authoritative. Use the cardinals for direction meaning and row 9 for cross-row identity, scale, registration, and continuity.

COHERENT SYNTHESIS LOCK: produce one unified eight-pose row. Do not paste, tile, or independently restyle individual cells. Every final cell must be drawn together with the same face construction, body proportions, line/render quality, lighting, materials, scale, baseline, and registration.

Output exactly 8 complete full-body frames in this exact left-to-right order: 180, 202.5, 225, 247.5, 270, 292.5, 315, 337.5. Degrees are clockwise: 000 is up, 090 right, 180 down, and 270 left. Neutral/front is not part of this row.

DIRECTION TARGETS — use these to shape the coherent row, not as pixel-level landmark gates:

1. `180`: vertical DOWN; no horizontal requirement.
2. `202.5`: horizontal SCREEN-LEFT and vertical DOWN.
3. `225`: horizontal SCREEN-LEFT and vertical DOWN.
4. `247.5`: horizontal SCREEN-LEFT and vertical DOWN.
5. `270`: horizontal SCREEN-LEFT; no vertical requirement.
6. `292.5`: horizontal SCREEN-LEFT and vertical UP.
7. `315`: horizontal SCREEN-LEFT and vertical UP.
8. `337.5`: horizontal SCREEN-LEFT and vertical UP.

Cardinals must be unmistakable. Intermediate poses should broadly occupy the intended quadrant and advance naturally through the ordered loop. Minor pupil, nose, eyelid, or aiming-feature deviations are acceptable when the overall direction, continuity, identity, and motion remain coherent. Do not deform the character merely to make every intermediate axis independently obvious.

SCREEN-COORDINATE LOCK: screen-left means the viewer's left image edge, never the character's own left. The row should travel naturally through the left half of the loop. Near-vertical 202.5 and 337.5 may have subtle horizontal cues; prioritize a coherent arc over exact pupil or nose placement.

HARD LAYOUT AND CONTINUITY CONTRACT — DETERMINISTIC REGISTRATION: draw exactly eight separated pose groups in left-to-right direction order. Keep enough chroma-only space between neighboring poses that each complete pose can be detected without cutting through foreground. Approximate the guide's equal spacing, but do not distort a pose merely to hit an exact source-canvas coordinate; deterministic assembly will crop the eight ordered groups, then apply one shared scale and baseline.

Use the same body height, head size, baseline, and planted-body position across the generated family. Never overlap neighboring poses, merge two poses into one connected group, crop foreground at the outer canvas edge, or resize one pose independently.

Keep the feet, base, or lower torso planted at the same coordinates across all eight frames. Express direction through the eyes, face, head, upper body, and physically appropriate prop movement, not by moving, rotating, or rescaling the entire sprite.

Place one centered pose in each invisible equal-width slot on flat pure magenta #FF00FF. Change only the natural parts needed to express gaze: eyes, eyelids, head, face, neck, upper body, appendages, and constrained prop follow-through. Keep identity, silhouette, materials, palette, markings, and props consistent.

ROW-BOUNDARY LOCK: 180 must continue directly from row 9's 157.5, matching its body size, baseline, planted anchor, expression, and construction. 337.5 must be one even 22.5-degree step before 000: nearly up-facing while remaining on the overall left-hand arc. Do not distort pupils, nose, or body geometry merely to exaggerate the subtle horizontal component.

PRE-RETURN CHECK: reject this result if it does not contain eight separated pose groups in the required order; neighboring poses overlap; foreground is cropped at the outer canvas edge; any frame changes sprite scale, body or head size, baseline, or planted-body position; the row visibly reverses into the wrong half of the loop; or 180 does not continue from 157.5 or 337.5 does not flow evenly into 000. Minor intermediate pupil or nose deviations are not rejection reasons. Exact cell cropping, resizing, and recentering happen deterministically after generation.

Do not rotate, skew, or tilt the whole sprite to fake gaze. Do not add replacement/googly eyes, labels, degree text, arrows, clocks, grids, shadows, glows, scenery, detached effects, or chroma-key colors inside the pet.



## look-row-9

Create one horizontal look-direction strip for Codex pet `rydia`, atlas row 9.

Use the attached canonical base, completed standard contact sheet, layout guide, and approved four-cardinal strip for identity, scale, registration, spacing, direction semantics, and cross-row continuity. Read `qa/look-mechanics.md` and follow its pet-specific movement and eye/prop mechanics. The approved cardinal strip is authoritative for the up, screen-right, down, and screen-left pose families. Interpolate the intermediate directions as even 22.5-degree steps between those anchors.

COHERENT SYNTHESIS LOCK: produce one unified eight-pose row. Do not paste, tile, or independently restyle individual cells. Every final cell must be drawn together with the same face construction, body proportions, line/render quality, lighting, materials, scale, baseline, and registration.

Output exactly 8 complete full-body frames in this exact left-to-right order: 000, 022.5, 045, 067.5, 090, 112.5, 135, 157.5. Degrees are clockwise: 000 is up, 090 right, 180 down, and 270 left. Neutral/front is not part of this row.

DIRECTION TARGETS — use these to shape the coherent row, not as pixel-level landmark gates:

1. `000`: vertical UP; no horizontal requirement.
2. `022.5`: horizontal SCREEN-RIGHT and vertical UP.
3. `045`: horizontal SCREEN-RIGHT and vertical UP.
4. `067.5`: horizontal SCREEN-RIGHT and vertical UP.
5. `090`: horizontal SCREEN-RIGHT; no vertical requirement.
6. `112.5`: horizontal SCREEN-RIGHT and vertical DOWN.
7. `135`: horizontal SCREEN-RIGHT and vertical DOWN.
8. `157.5`: horizontal SCREEN-RIGHT and vertical DOWN.

Cardinals must be unmistakable. Intermediate poses should broadly occupy the intended quadrant and advance naturally through the ordered loop. Minor pupil, nose, eyelid, or aiming-feature deviations are acceptable when the overall direction, continuity, identity, and motion remain coherent. Do not deform the character merely to make every intermediate axis independently obvious.

SCREEN-COORDINATE LOCK: screen-right means the viewer's right image edge, never the character's own right. The row should travel naturally through the right half of the loop. Near-vertical 022.5 and 157.5 may have subtle horizontal cues; prioritize a coherent arc over exact pupil or nose placement.

HARD LAYOUT AND CONTINUITY CONTRACT — DETERMINISTIC REGISTRATION: draw exactly eight separated pose groups in left-to-right direction order. Keep enough chroma-only space between neighboring poses that each complete pose can be detected without cutting through foreground. Approximate the guide's equal spacing, but do not distort a pose merely to hit an exact source-canvas coordinate; deterministic assembly will crop the eight ordered groups, then apply one shared scale and baseline.

Use the same body height, head size, baseline, and planted-body position across the generated family. Never overlap neighboring poses, merge two poses into one connected group, crop foreground at the outer canvas edge, or resize one pose independently.

Keep the feet, base, or lower torso planted at the same coordinates across all eight frames. Express direction through the eyes, face, head, upper body, and physically appropriate prop movement, not by moving, rotating, or rescaling the entire sprite.

Place one centered pose in each invisible equal-width slot on flat pure magenta #FF00FF. Change only the natural parts needed to express gaze: eyes, eyelids, head, face, neck, upper body, appendages, and constrained prop follow-through. Keep identity, silhouette, materials, palette, markings, and props consistent.

ROW-BOUNDARY LOCK: 157.5 must be one even 22.5-degree step before 180. Match the approved 180 pose's body size, baseline, planted anchor, expression, and construction. Preserve the overall right-hand arc, but do not distort pupils, nose, or body geometry merely to exaggerate the subtle horizontal component.

PRE-RETURN CHECK: reject this result if it does not contain eight separated pose groups in the required order; neighboring poses overlap; foreground is cropped at the outer canvas edge; any frame changes sprite scale, body or head size, baseline, or planted-body position; the row visibly reverses into the wrong half of the loop; or 157.5 does not flow evenly into 180. Minor intermediate pupil or nose deviations are not rejection reasons. Exact cell cropping, resizing, and recentering happen deterministically after generation.

Do not rotate, skew, or tilt the whole sprite to fake gaze. Do not add replacement/googly eyes, labels, degree text, arrows, clocks, grids, shadows, glows, scenery, detached effects, or chroma-key colors inside the pet.

- Do not draw wave marks, motion arcs, lines, sparkles, symbols, or floating effects around the gesture.

Clean extraction: crisp opaque edges, safe padding, no scenery, text, guide marks, checkerboard, shadows, glows, motion blur, speed lines, dust, detached effects, stray pixels, or chroma-key colors inside the pet.



## look-cardinals

Create one horizontal four-cardinal anchor strip for Codex pet `rydia`.

Use the attached canonical base, completed standard contact sheet, and layout guide for exact identity, style, scale, baseline, face construction, materials, palette, markings, props, and spacing. Read `qa/look-mechanics.md` and use the pet's natural gaze mechanism.

Output exactly four centered complete full-body poses in this exact left-to-right order: `000 up`, `090 screen-right`, `180 down`, `270 screen-left`. Screen-left and screen-right always mean the viewer's image edges, never the character's own left or right.

For `000`, keep the face broadly frontal and point the eyes and natural head mechanism toward the TOP edge. For `090`, put the nose tip, pupils, face surface, or natural aiming feature on the screen-right side of the head center. For `180`, keep the face broadly frontal and point toward the BOTTOM edge. For `270`, apply the inverse screen-left landmark rule. Every cardinal must be unmistakable without labels.

Place one pose in each invisible equal-width slot on a flat pure magenta #FF00FF background with generous padding. Keep scale, feet/base, lower body, and registration consistent across all four slots.

Do not rotate, skew, or tilt the whole sprite to fake gaze. Do not add replacement eyes, labels, degree text, arrows, boxes, guide marks, shadows, scenery, detached effects, or chroma-key colors inside the pet.
